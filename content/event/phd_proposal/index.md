abstract: I am excited to share that I have successfully passed my PhD proposal defense! My research focuses on machine learning-based and model-based vehicle dynamics and control, with an emphasis on Gaussian Process (GP) modeling for autonomous racing vehicles. In my proposal, I explored how GP can be leveraged to enhance vehicle dynamics predictions by correcting model mismatches, and I discussed its potential applications in high-speed autonomous racing and uncertainty-aware control. This milestone marks a significant step toward completing my PhD, and I look forward to refining my research further as I work toward my dissertation.
