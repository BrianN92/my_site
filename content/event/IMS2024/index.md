abstract:  On September 6th, I had the incredible opportunity to help lead Cavalier Autonomous Racing to victory at the Indy Autonomous Challenge time trial competition. We completed a blistering 52.628-second lap on the historic 2.5-mile oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedwayâ€”averaging 171.012 mph (273.619 kph) and pulling 2.25 lateral Gs through the turns. During that winning lap, our car hit a top speed of 184 mph (296 kph), setting a new world record for autonomous racing on a closed circuit. This also marks the first time a U.S.-based team has topped the podium at an [**Indy Autonomous Challenge**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/indy-autonomous-challenge/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BYYVcJXOwSmiwjH66VheRvA%3D%3D) competition!
