abstract: Our work on Data-Driven Model Predictive Control for Real-Time Stormwater Management has been presented at ACC 2022. The American Control Conference (ACC) is the annual conference of the American Automatic Control Council (AACC), the U.S. national member organization of the International Currently, nine professional societies, listed on each page of this site, are members of the AACC â€“ the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the International Society for Automation (ISA), the Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS), the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), and Applied Probability Society as a subdivision of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS APS). AACC is a federation of these professional societies.
